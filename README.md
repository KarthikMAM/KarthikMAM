          (May 2017 - Feb 2019)
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Built a suite of tools and services that manage metadata about movies, theatres, actors, production houses in the film industry.</li>
          <li>Re-architected a platform called Moviebuff, to progressively move away from a monolith architecture to a mix of micro-service and server-less architecture. Built high throughput and scalable APIs as a part of this migration that are now consumed by top companies like Spotify, Justickets, SPI Cinemas etc.</li>
          <li>Built systems that represent multiple versions (dubs, multilinguals) of the same movie as a tree, which enables complex metadata to flow down the tree with intelligent downstream patching, conflict resolution and approval flows.</li>
          <li>Built de-duplication systems that uses configurable heuristics to identify potential movie, actors, production houses, theatre duplicates and allows for intelligent merging of such duplicates with diff review, conflict resolution and approval flows.</li>
          <li>Built performant consumer web UI that utilised a multitude of web technologies like service workers, server side rendering, progressive web apps etc. to deliver fluid navigations, standalone offline experience etc. (Note: This has been de-prioritised and further development was postponed).</li>
          <li>Built configurable forms engine which enables developers to create beautiful and responsive web forms for complex data entry jobs using only a simple JSON object in a matter of a few minutes (structure similar to JSON schema). Some of the features of the engine include complex validations, data fetching for selects, automatic data flow management inside complex nested forms etc.</li>
          <li>Integrated the Moviebuff platform with EIDR <a href="https://eidr.org/">(https://eidr.org/)</a>.</li>
          <li>Built tools that manage CPLs (Composition Playlist) and their related movies.</li>
          <li>Built scalable scrapers that scrape ticketing information from different websites like BookMyShow, Justickets, SPI Cinemas etc. with an intelligent mapping system to map the scraped shows to theatres, movies, language, date and time etc.</li>
